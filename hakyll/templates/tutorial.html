<h2>Helping out</h2>

Hakyll is an open source project, and one of the hardest parts is writing
correct, up-to-date, and understandable documentation. Therefore, the
authors would really appreciate it if you would
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hakyll">give some feedback</a> about
the tutorials, and especially report errors or difficulties you encountered.
Thanks!
