## Overview

Hakyll is a [Haskell](http://haskell.org) library for generating static sites.
It is written in a very configurable way and uses an
[xmonad](http://xmonad.org)-like DSL for configuration.

## Why static site generators?

- Static sites are extremely fast.
- You don't have to worry about security issues.

## Features of Hakyll

- Integration with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) gives us markdown
  and TeX support, including syntax highlighting and other goodies.
- An easy templating system.
- Hakyll also features a simple http server for previewing your site.

## Getting Started

You can get the latest version from hackage using `cabal install hakyll`. A
look in the [tutorial](tutorial1.html) is highly recommended. There are a few
examples available in
[the github repo](http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/tree/master/examples/),
including this site.
