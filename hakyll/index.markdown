## Overview

Hakyll is a [Haskell](http://haskell.org) library for generating static sites,
mostly aimed at small-to-medium sites and personal blogs. It is written in a
very configurable way and uses an [xmonad](http://xmonad.org)-like DSL for
configuration.

Integration with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) gives us markdown
and TeX support, including syntax highlighting and other goodies.

## Hakyll 3

Hakyll 3 has been released, and it can be installed by running
`cabal install hakyll`. For a limited time (but as long as is necessary) you can
access the old site and documentation [here](/hakyll2).

## Getting Started

You can get the latest version from hackage using `cabal install hakyll`. Then,
you can:

- read the [tutorial](/tutorial.html);
- mail the [google discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/hakyll);
- ask questions on the IRC channel: `#hakyll` on
  [freenode](http://freenode.net/).
