## Hakyll 3

Hakyll 3 has been released, and it can be installed by running
`cabal install hakyll`. For a limited time (but as long as is necessary) you can
access the old site and documentation [here](/hakyll2)

## Overview

Hakyll is a [Haskell](http://haskell.org) library for generating static sites,
mostly aimed at small-to-medium sites and personal blogs. It is written in a
very configurable way and uses an [xmonad](http://xmonad.org)-like DSL for
configuration.

## Why static site generators?

- Static sites are extremely fast.
- You don't have to worry about security issues.

## Features of Hakyll

- Integration with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) gives us markdown
  and TeX support, including syntax highlighting and other goodies.
- An easy templating system.
- Hakyll also features a simple http server for previewing your site.

## See some examples

Some sites written in Hakyll:

- Blog of [Demotera](http://blog.demotera.com/), a French engineering company
- Personal home page and blog of [Chris Done](http://chrisdone.com/)
- Personal home page and blog of [Jasper Van der Jeugt](http://jaspervdj.be/)
- [The Haskell Alphabet](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/haskell-alphabet/)

- Personal home page and blog of [Nicolas Wu](http://zenzike.com/)

## Getting Started

You can get the latest version from hackage using `cabal install hakyll`. I
have written a few [tutorials](tutorials.html), and reading them is highly
recommended if you want to get started with hakyll. Also, there are a few
examples available in
[the github repo](http://github.com/jaspervdj/Hakyll/tree/master/examples/),
including this site. For any questions you might have, there is also a
[google discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/hakyll).
